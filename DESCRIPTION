Description: Calculates a number of valuation adjustments including CVA, DVA,
    FBA, FCA, MVA and KVA. A two-way margin agreement has been implemented. For
    the KVA calculation three regulatory frameworks are supported: CEM, (simplified) SA-CCR, OEM
	and IMM. The probability of default is implied through the credit spreads curve.
    Currently, only IRSwaps are supported. For more information, you can check
