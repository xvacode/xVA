Calculates Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments

Calculates a number of valuation adjustments including CVA, DVA, FBA, FCA, MVA and KVA. 

A two-way margin agreement has been implemented. 

 For the KVA calculation three regulatory frameworks are supported: CEM, (simplified) SA-CCR, OEM and IMM.

The probability of default is implied through the credit spreads curve.

The package supports an exposure calculation based on SA-CCR which includes several trade types and a simulated path which is currently available only for IRSwaps.

The latest regulatory capital charge methodologies have been implementing including BA-CVA & SA-CVA.
