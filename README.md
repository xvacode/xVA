Calculates Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments

Calculates a number of valuation adjustments including CVA, DVA, FBA, FCA, MVA and KVA. 

A two-way margin agreement has been implemented. 

For the KVA calculation three regulatory frameworks are supported: CEM, SA-CCR and IMM. 

The probability of default is implied through the credit spreads curve. Currently, only IRSwaps are supported.
